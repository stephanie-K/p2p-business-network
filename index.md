In response to this time of extraordinary challenge, this network offers a digital space, for business to meet, engage with each other, and work collaboratively in order to help themselves and other businesses in Scotland.

The primary aim of the Network is to be purposeful and practical – with a focus on businesses sharing knowledge and insights, sourcing help, posing solutions to mutual challenges and opportunities.


This Network has been created to support businesses in this time of extraordinary challenge  and help to:
- create informal business focused peer to peer support
- provide a digital space where businesses can engage on specific ‘asks’ and ‘offers’
- be facilitated by Scottish Enterprise - from sharing our insight, engaging in conversations, asking questions, as well as connecting people and conversations
- help businesses to exchange insights and learn from each other in a fast-moving environment with the option to do so in both public and private channels
- build new alliances across Scotland’s business community to help drive economic growth post the COVID-19 situation
- insights generated from this activity will help identify emerging trends that can help inform Scottish Enterprise’s support to Scotland’s businesses


Staff from Scottish Enterprise will help to facilitate the Network, helping to encourage engagement of relevant business themes as well as offer insights and support when needed.
