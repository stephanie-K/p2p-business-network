## Act properly and responsibly

**You agree NOT to:**

- give the impression that any contribution you make to the Network emanates from Scottish Enterprise, if this is not the case
- promote violence, or include content which contains a statement which you know or believe, may be understood by members of the public as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism

## Action we will take if you break the rules of engagement:

When we consider that any of the rules above have been breached, we may take such action as we deem appropriate.

Failure to comply with these rules of engagement constitutes a material breach of the terms of use [[https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/terms-of-service/user]](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/terms-of-service/user) upon which you are permitted to use the Network, and may result in our taking all or any of the following actions:

- immediate, temporary or permanent withdrawal of your right to use the Network
- immediate, temporary or permanent removal of any contribution uploaded by you to the Network
- issue of a warning to you
- legal proceedings against you for reimbursement of all costs on an indemnity basis (including, but not limited to, reasonable administrative and legal costs) resulting from the breach
- take legal action against you, where we consider this as appropriate
- disclosure of such information to law enforcement authorities as we reasonably feel is necessary or as required by law

We exclude our liability for all action we may take in response to breaches of these rules of engagement. The actions we may take are not limited to those described above, and we may take any other action we reasonably deem appropriate.

## Reporting Process:

We are committed to providing an accessible and useful service for the Scottish Business community. 

However, if you believe that things have gone wrong, please send your complaints or comments to the Facilitator team through the **#report-an-issue** channel.

We will try to respond to any complaint within five working days.

If our response is not to your satisfaction, you may ask that it is referred to the Director of Customer Experience, whose decision is final.

You must not post complaints on the discussion channels and only use the channel **#report-an-issue** for this purpose.
